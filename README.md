# Lyft-Perception-Challenge
I could be ranked 14th globally among 300+ scientists and engineers participated in this competition.
There was a 30-day period of time to develop a semantic segmentation model but I came to know of this competition in the last days remaining to the submission deadline. Good result for few days of work...
The top 25 competitors were secured an interview with a Lyft hiring representative!

Below you can see the final leaderboard of challenge.
