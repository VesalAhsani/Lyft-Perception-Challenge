# Lyft-Perception-Challenge
I could be ranked 14th globally among 300+ scientists and engineers participated in this competition.
There was a 30-day period of time to develop a semantic segmentation model but I came to know of this competition in the last days remaining to the submission deadline. Good result for few days of work...
